This is my fork of ManyAnims that has many code changes and added feeatures to accomodate for my uses.

You need to use this with my fork of CODMayaTools for it to work properly.

This is BO3 & Maya 2023 only, check out the original project for IW/SH and Maya 2022 support.

## Features
  ### - Cast Support (Removed seanim support)
  
  ### - Automatic Selection of joints
  instead of manually selecting joints, the script does it for you, choosing the correct joints for the animation

  ### - Support for Dual Wield LH and RH specific animations
  
  ### - XANIM_EXPORT support
  You can only export in XANIM_EXPORT on this fork as XANIM_BIN export is broken on CODMayaTools 2023
#
All code related to COD4[MW] has been removed as I don't use them.

Also, did some changes to the Menu to accomodate for this, and made the Export Button and actual button.
